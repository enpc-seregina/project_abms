# Template repository - Mini project
## Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) of Mobility and Transportation.

This template is the basis for the mini-project as a part of the ABMS of Mobility and Transportation course.

The template will serve to create your own multi-agent simulation model for a case study through the construction of a computer simulation, followed by tests and analyzes of different mobility scenarios.

To create your own github repository with the proposed structure,<br/>
&nbsp; **Step 1:** On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.<br/>
&nbsp; **Step 2:** Above the file list, click **Use this template**.<br/>
  **Step 3:** Select **Create a new repository**.<br/>
  **Step 4:** Use the **Owner** drop-down menu, and select the account you want to own the repository.<br/>
  **Step 5:** Type a name for your repository, and description (optional).<br/>
  **Step 6:** Choose a repository visibility (**Public** or **Internal**).<br/>
  **Step 7:** Select **Include all branches** in case you wish to include the directory structure and files from all branches in the template, and not just the default branch.<br/>
  **Step 8:** Optionally, if the personal account or organization in which you're creating uses any GitHub Apps from GitHub Marketplace, select any apps you'd like to use in the repository.<br/>
  **Step 9:** Click **Create repository from template**.<br/>
