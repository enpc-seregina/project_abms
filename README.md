# Template repository - mini project - Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) of Mobility and Transportation.

This template is the basis for the mini-project as a part of the ABMS of Mobility and Transportation course.

The template will serve to create your own multi-agent simulation model for a case study through the construction of a computer simulation, followed by tests and analyzes of different mobility scenarios.

To create your own github repository with the proposed structure, see ["Creating a repository from a template."](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
