Template repository - mini project - Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) of Mobility and Transportation.

This template is the basis for the mini-project as a part of the ABMS of Mobility and Transportation course.

The template will serve to create your own multi-agent simulation model for a case study through the construction of a computer simulation, followed by tests and analyzes of different mobility scenarios.
